Credit
Problem to Solve
In a filed called credit.py in a folder called sentimental-credit, write a program that prompts
the user for a credit card number and then reports (via print) whether it is a valid American Express,
MasterCard, or Visa card number, exactly as you did in Problem Set 1. Your program this time should be
written in Python!

Demo

Specification
So that we can automate some tests of your code, we ask that your program‚Äôs last line of output be AMEX\n
or MASTERCARD\n or VISA\n or INVALID\n, nothing more, nothing less.
For simplicity, you may assume that the user‚Äôs input will be entirely numeric (i.e., devoid of hyphens, as
might be printed on an actual card).
Best to use get_int or get_string from CS50‚Äôs library to get users‚Äô input, depending on how you to decide
to implement this one.
Hints
It‚Äôs possible to use regular expressions to validate user input. You might use Python‚Äôs re module, for
example, to check whether the user‚Äôs input is indeed a sequence of digits of the correct length.
How to Test
While check50 is available for this problem, you‚Äôre encouraged to first test your code on your own for
each of the following.

Run your program as python credit.py, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in 378282246310005 and press
enter. Your program should output AMEX.
Run your program as python credit.py, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in 371449635398431 and press
enter. Your program should output AMEX.
Run your program as python credit.py, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in 5555555555554444 and press
enter. Your program should output MASTERCARD.
Run your program as python credit.py, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in 5105105105105100 and press
enter. Your program should output MASTERCARD.
Run your program as python credit.py, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in 4111111111111111 and press
enter. Your program should output VISA.
Run your program as python credit.py, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in 4012888888881881 and press
enter. Your program should output VISA.
Run your program as python credit.py, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in 1234567890 and press enter.
Your program should output INVALID.

How to Submit
submit50 cs50/problems/2024/x/sentimental/credit
Why does my submission pass check50, but shows ‚ÄúNo results‚Äù in my Gradebook after running submit50?

In some cases, submit50 may not grade the assignment due to inconsistent formatting in your credit.py file. To fix this issue, run black credit.py in the sentimental-credit folder. Address any issues that are revealed. Run check50 again to ensure your submission still functions. Finally, run the submit50 command above again. Your result will appear in your Gradebook within a few minutes.

Please note that if there is a numerical score next to your credit submission in the submissions area of your Gradebook, the procedure discussed above does not apply to you. Likely, you have not fully addressed the requirements of the problem set and should rely upon check50 for clues as to what work remains.

Credit
Person holding credit cards

Problem to Solve
A credit (or debit) card, of course, is a plastic card with which you can pay for goods and services. Printed on that card is a number that‚Äôs also stored in a database somewhere, so that when your card is used to buy something, the creditor knows whom to bill. There are a lot of people with credit cards in this world, so those numbers are pretty long: American Express uses 15-digit numbers, MasterCard uses 16-digit numbers, and Visa uses 13- and 16-digit numbers. And those are decimal numbers (0 through 9), not binary, which means, for instance, that American Express could print as many as 10^15 = 1,000,000,000,000,000 unique cards! (That‚Äôs, um, a quadrillion.)

Actually, that‚Äôs a bit of an exaggeration, because credit card numbers actually have some structure to them. All American Express numbers start with 34 or 37; most MasterCard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55 (they also have some other potential starting numbers which we won‚Äôt concern ourselves with for this problem); and all Visa numbers start with 4. But credit card numbers also have a ‚Äúchecksum‚Äù built into them, a mathematical relationship between at least one number and others. That checksum enables computers (or humans who like math) to detect typos (e.g., transpositions), if not fraudulent numbers, without having to query a database, which can be slow. Of course, a dishonest mathematician could certainly craft a fake number that nonetheless respects the mathematical constraint, so a database lookup is still necessary for more rigorous checks.

In a file called credit.c in a folder called credit, implement a program in C that checks the validity of a given credit card number.

Luhn‚Äôs Algorithm
So what‚Äôs the secret formula? Well, most cards use an algorithm invented by Hans Peter Luhn of IBM. According to Luhn‚Äôs algorithm, you can determine if a credit card number is (syntactically) valid as follows:

Multiply every other digit by 2, starting with the number‚Äôs second-to-last digit, and then add those products‚Äô digits together.
Add the sum to the sum of the digits that weren‚Äôt multiplied by 2.
If the total‚Äôs last digit is 0 (or, put more formally, if the total modulo 10 is congruent to 0), the number is valid!
That‚Äôs kind of confusing, so let‚Äôs try an example with David‚Äôs Visa: 4003600000000014.

For the sake of discussion, let‚Äôs first underline every other digit, starting with the number‚Äôs second-to-last digit:

4003600000000014

Okay, let‚Äôs multiply each of the underlined digits by 2:

1‚Ä¢2 + 0‚Ä¢2 + 0‚Ä¢2 + 0‚Ä¢2 + 0‚Ä¢2 + 6‚Ä¢2 + 0‚Ä¢2 + 4‚Ä¢2

That gives us:

2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 12 + 0 + 8

Now let‚Äôs add those products‚Äô digits (i.e., not the products themselves) together:

2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 13

Now let‚Äôs add that sum (13) to the sum of the digits that weren‚Äôt multiplied by 2 (starting from the end):

13 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 20

Yup, the last digit in that sum (20) is a 0, so David‚Äôs card is legit!

So, validating credit card numbers isn‚Äôt hard, but it does get a bit tedious by hand. Let‚Äôs write a program.

Implementation Details
In the file called credit.c in the credit directory, write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via printf) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of each‚Äôs format herein. So that we can automate some tests of your code, we ask that your program‚Äôs last line of output be AMEX\n or MASTERCARD\n or VISA\n or INVALID\n, nothing more, nothing less. For simplicity, you may assume that the user‚Äôs input will be entirely numeric (i.e., devoid of hyphens, as might be printed on an actual card) and that it won‚Äôt have leading zeroes. But do not assume that the user‚Äôs input will fit in an int! Best to use get_long from CS50‚Äôs library to get users‚Äô input. (Why?)

Consider the below representative of how your own program should behave when passed a valid credit card number (sans hyphens).

$ ./credit
Number: 4003600000000014
VISA
Now, get_long itself will reject hyphens (and more) anyway:

$ ./credit
Number: 4003-6000-0000-0014
Number: foo
Number: 4003600000000014
VISA
But it‚Äôs up to you to catch inputs that are not credit card numbers (e.g., a phone number), even if numeric:

$ ./credit
Number: 6176292929
INVALID
Test out your program with a whole bunch of inputs, both valid and invalid. (We certainly will!) Here are a few card numbers that PayPal recommends for testing.

If your program behaves incorrectly on some inputs (or doesn‚Äôt compile at all), time to debug!
