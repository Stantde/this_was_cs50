Emojize
Because emoji aren‚Äôt quite as easy to type as text, at least on laptops and desktops, some programs support ‚Äúcodes,‚Äù whereby you can type, for instance, :thumbs_up:, which will be automatically converted to üëç. Some programs additionally support aliases, whereby you can more succinctly type, for instance, :thumbsup:, which will also be automatically converted to üëç.

See carpedm20.github.io/emoji/all.html?enableList=enable_list_alias for a list of codes with aliases.

In a file called emojize.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str in English and then outputs the ‚Äúemojized‚Äù version of that str, converting any codes (or aliases) therein to their corresponding emoji.

Hints
Note that the emoji module comes with two functions, per pypi.org/project/emoji, one of which is emojize, which takes an optional, named parameter called language. You can install it with:
pip install emoji
Demo

Before You Begin
Log into cs50.dev, click on your terminal window, and execute cd by itself. You should find that your terminal window‚Äôs prompt resembles the below:

$
Next execute

mkdir emojize
to make a folder called emojize in your codespace.

Then execute

cd emojize
to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as emojize/ $. You can now execute

code emojize.py
to make a file called emojize.py where you‚Äôll write your program.

How to Test
Here‚Äôs how to test your code manually:

Run your program with python emojize.py. Type :1st_place_medal: and press Enter. Your program should output:
Output: ü•á
Run your program with python emojize.py. Type :money_bag: and press Enter. Your program should output:
Output: üí∞
Run your program with python emojize.py. Type :smile_cat: and press Enter. Your program should output:
Output: üò∏
You can execute the below to check your code using check50, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/emojize
Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that check50 outputs to see the input check50 handed to your program, what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

How to Submit
In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

Example:
>>> import emoji
>>> print(emoji.emojize('Python is :thumbs_up:'))
Python is üëç
'''
import emoji

def main():
    input_to_emojize = input("Input: ")
    emojized_input = emoji.emojize(input_to_emojize, language='alias')
    print(f'Output: {emojized_input}')
    #import sys

    #print(sys.path)
    #print(sys.executable)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
